Whenisbest is an RCOS project that started in the Fall of 2016 at RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute).
Contributors include: Erin Jordan, Helen Lei, Jon Harris, Shreya Patel, Zefanya Putri, Ying Guo

The goal of whenisbest is to facilitate group scheduling based on the members' (anonymous) schedules. It will involve automated scheduling to determine a time or day where most of your friends/family/group members will be free and available. Users input their main schedules into the application and events will be added or deleted to their schedules accordingly, based on what they sign up for.

Check out our project page on [rcos.io](rcos.io): [https://rcos.io/projects/whenisbest/whenisbest/profile](https://rcos.io/projects/whenisbest/whenisbest/profile) where you can see our proposal for the semester.

##Tools used

whenisbest uses [Ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) which includes HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/CoffeeScript for the front-end.
We've used this ruby on rails [tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) to get started. If you've never used ruby on rails before and would like to try out the whenisbest source code this tutorial should provide the how-tos for all the installation you need. 

You should be greeted by this page when you run whenisbest:

Once you have ruby on rails set up, you should be able to run bin/rails server (ruby bin\rails server for windows) and go to localhost:3000 on your webrowser to run\use whenisbest. If you want to edit the source code, you should be able to use just any code text editor. 

whenisbest has only been tested on the windows operating system. Our team members use Ruby version 2.2 OR 2.3 with Rails version 5.
