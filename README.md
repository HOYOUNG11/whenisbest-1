The best whenisgood.

### Purpose
This project focuses on developing a “Group Calendar” for people. It will involve automated scheduling to determine a time or day where most of your friends/family/group members will be free and available. Users input their main schedules into the application and events will be added or deleted to their schedules accordingly, based on what they sign up for. We will also make groups and chat boxes accordingly. 

### Proposed functionality:
- Importing calendars for a group of people that will auto-generate the best times for a group of people to meet.
- Will allow people to rank their types of current obligations (strict, flexible)
- Permits privacy, so nobody else will know exactly what you're up to

### Audience
Anyone with a busy schedule. 

### Languages
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails 

### Goals
- GOAL 1: Get familiar with Ruby on Rails
- GOAL 2: Skeleton of the web app/Layout of application, set up a web server/domain or localhost for development, Have basic front-end
- GOAL 3: Implement basic features (Be able to sync with Google Calendar, give users the ability to input/edit their calendars and make sure other users can’t see their calendars, give users ability to make groups, algorithm to automate scheduling for meetings/events)

### Features Wanted in the Future
- Sync with Facebook events if possible? Or be able to automatically pull in events from the area
- ChatBox to be able to discuss
- Events: Event planner with optimal times to host event, Events sorted by certain factors (e.g. number of people available, etc.)
