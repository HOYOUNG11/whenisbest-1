A better when is good. (lol)

Funny, you're hilarious, Jon.

Group calendar.

Proposed functionality:
-Importing calendars for a group of people that will autogenerate the best times for a group
of people to meet.

-Will allow people to rank their types of current obligations (strict, flexible)

-Permits privacy, so nobody else will know exactly what you're up to (cough cough)

Tools: Ruby on Rails (web dev)
